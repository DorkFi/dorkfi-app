## Understanding Rewards

### Reward Structure

- **Total Pool**: 5,000,000 VOI tokens
- **Distribution**: Based on stake-seconds (amount × time until launch)
- **Market Allocation**: Different markets receive different percentages of rewards

### Market Allocations

Rewards are distributed based on **actual USD deposit values** across all markets and **all networks**:

- **Cross-Network Allocation**: Rewards are allocated across both Algorand and Voi networks
- **Global USD Pool**: All deposits across all networks contribute to the total USD pool
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Each market's share of rewards is proportional to the total USD value deposited in that market globally
- **Real-time Calculation**: Allocations are calculated based on live deposit data from all networks
- **Fair Distribution**: Markets with more deposits receive proportionally more rewards
- **Open System**: No predetermined percentages - allocations emerge from user behavior across all networks

### How Market Allocations Work

1. **Total Deposits**: Sum of all USD deposits across all markets on all networks (Algorand + Voi)
2. **Market Share**: Each market's USD deposits ÷ total USD deposits across all networks
3. **Reward Allocation**: Market share × total VOI reward pool
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Allocations change as users deposit/withdraw on any network

### Example Allocation Calculation

If total deposits across all markets and networks are:
- VOI: $1,000,000 (40% of total)
- UNIT: $750,000 (30% of total)  
- BTC: $500,000 (20% of total)
- Others: $250,000 (10% of total)

Then reward allocations would be:
- VOI: 40% of 5M VOI = 2M VOI
- UNIT: 30% of 5M VOI = 1.5M VOI
- BTC: 20% of 5M VOI = 1M VOI
- Others: 10% of 5M VOI = 500K VOI

**Note**: These allocations are global across both Algorand and Voi networks.

### How Rewards Are Calculated

1. **Stake-Seconds**: Your deposit amount × seconds until launch
2. **Global Market Share**: Your stake-seconds vs. total market stake-seconds across all networks
3. **Reward Share**: Market allocation × your market share
4. **Final Reward**: Your share of the 5M VOI pool

**Cross-Network Competition**: Your rewards depend on your stake-seconds relative to all users across both Algorand and Voi networks, not just your current network.

## APY Calculations

### What APY Shows

The Estimated APY combines:
- **Base Lending APY**: From the underlying lending protocol
- **PreFi Reward APY**: From VOI rewards (time-weighted)
- **Risk Adjustment**: Based on token risk factors

### APY Components

1. **Base APY**: Traditional lending yield
2. **PreFi Rewards**: Additional VOI rewards
3. **Risk Factor**: Adjustment based on token stability
4. **Time Factor**: Rewards decrease as launch approaches

### APY Examples

- **Early Deposits**: Higher APY due to longer time until launch
- **Late Deposits**: Lower APY but still competitive
- **Large Deposits**: Better APY due to higher stake-seconds
